# webRTC-based Streaming

## Background
On May 28 this year, as part of our virtual special session series, DASH-IF invited the colleagues from Verizon Media and Phenix Real Time Solutions to provide as an overview on a WebRTC-based Premium Streaming Ecosystem. WebRTC is the foundational technology for real-time streaming online and as such has widespread support across browsers. It is used widely across many applications. However, the use of real-time streaming for professionally-produced content is highlighting gaps in WebRTC, creating the need for industry collaboration. This [talk](https://dash-industry-forum.github.io/docs/FINAL-PUBLIC-WebRTC-based%20Premium%20Streaming%20Ecosystem.pdf) explored some of these key areas and sketch out possible ways forward for the industry.

We identified the synergies between the approach presented and DASH-based streaming. There was quite some interested to explore more details and DASH-IF will continue the informal discussion. The basic idea is to develop a position paper in DASH-IF together with the colleagues from Verizon Media and Phenix Real Time Solutions and identify if DASH-IF or other organizations can address any of the open issues and coordinate the work. 

## Scope
Based on the above background, an activity is started in DASH-IF to investigate some of the opportunities and synergies in this context. Specifically, the following scope is agreed:
- Review and extend the use cases presented in the slides
- Identify existing technologies for the above use cases
- Develop basic architecture for webRTC-based low-latency streaming including call flows for 
  - Session handling
  - Different experiences (latency, etc.)
  - DRM
  - Scalability (concurrent streaming for many users)
- Identify synergies and overlaps with DASH/CMAF
  - Specification
  - Implementation on backend, distribution and client  
- Identify gaps and requirements
- Identify next steps
- Publish the findings in a white paper/position paper
The possible outcome of the work may be that we identify overlaps with DASH to explore in DASH-IF or defer work to possibly other organizations.
